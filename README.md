## Solution Retrospective

### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I am proud of how quickly I was able to complete this challenge, and I’m particularly happy with how much neater my CSS turned out compared to previous projects. For next time, I’d like to experiment with using a **CSS framework** like Bootstrap.

### What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

One of the main challenges I faced was with the **images not loading** on the live site. I spent a few hours troubleshooting, thinking the issue was with the paths or something else, but eventually realized that I hadn’t used `git add` to commit the image files to the repository. Once I added the images to GitHub, the problem was resolved.

### What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

I’d love some guidance on using a **CSS framework**, specifically **Bootstrap**. I want to learn how to incorporate it into my projects to improve the overall responsiveness of my designs.
